                <p>Carol has always loved reading, so her fading eyesight is a sorrow to her. She tried recorded books, but she didn’t like it. She made the transition from ledgers to a software program, so she’s happy to use the computer. She has a computer, which she uses the same way she always did her work. She loves geting emails from her grandkids and friends. She likes reading magazine articles online, especially when they are free. Last year, she discovered that she could get her prescriptions more cheaply online, and now she buys some things from the web. Her biggest problem is that the text is so small. She’s learned how to click on the symbol to make the text bigger, but is frustrated when it doesn’t work the same way on every site. She also finds that her hands aren’t as steady as they used to be, and she can’t always click on things accurately. She likes her “old fashioned” mobile phone with large buttons that she can feel easily. As her eyes get worse, she wonders how long she’ll be able to keep using the computer. All that light gray text on a white screen. It’s just too hard to see.</p>
